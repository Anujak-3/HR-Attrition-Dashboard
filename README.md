# HR Employee Attrition Dashboard

This is a Power BI dashboard project that analyzes key factors influencing employee attrition in an organization. The goal is to identify high-risk job roles, understand the impact of work conditions, and help businesses take informed decisions to improve employee retention.

## 📌 Overview

- **Tool Used:** Power BI  
- **Data Source:** IBM HR Analytics Dataset  
- **Additional Tool:** SQL Server (used for querying and gaining insights before visualization)

The dashboard explores attrition patterns based on job roles, age, business travel, overtime, job satisfaction, and environment satisfaction.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Sales Representatives face the highest attrition risk across all filters.
- Attrition increases from 31% to 66% when overtime is true.
- Lab Technicians with overtime cross 50% attrition (14+ at direct risk).
- Business travel combined with low job satisfaction = top attrition trigger.
- Research Directors show low attrition, but high salaries make even minor exits financially risky.
